The database models for [PlaceOS](https://place.technology/) in [crystal](https://crystal-lang.org/).

PlaceOS is a distributed application, with many concurrent event sources that require persistence.
We use [RethinkDB](https://rethinkdb.com) to unify our database and event bus, giving us a consistent interface to state and events across the system.
